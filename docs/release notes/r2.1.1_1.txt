Objeck v2.1.1_1

This release includes a refactored C++ API.  Current and upcoming releases will leverage the native API to provide database (ODBC) and GUI (GTK+) support.  This interim release fixes critical bugs that were found during GTK+ integration.  The following bugs have been resolved:
* Fixed a memory manager bug related to the scanning of methods with higher-order functions 
* Fixed a compiler bug that was assigning the same type ID to certain static and instance memory blocks
* Resolved a recently introduced compiler bug that caused the compiler to crash if certain shared library references couldn’t be resolved
* Changed the return value of the StringMap class’s Find method to return a Base class
* Now allow more than one bundle to be defined in an .obe file

The Objeck programming language is a light-weight object-oriented programming language with functional features. The programming system consists of a compiler, virtual machine (with garbage collector and JIT compiler) along with a command line debugger.
